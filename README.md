## Adding Data for Suppliers and Customers

Currently, **Suppliers** and **Customers** can only be added via SQL commands. Follow these steps:

1. **Open MySQL Command Line**  
   Access your MySQL database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```
   Enter your MySQL password when prompted.

2. **Switch to the Database**  
   Use the database for this project:
   ```sql
   USE superdatabase;
   ```

3. **Insert a New Supplier**  
   Use the following SQL command to add a supplier:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO suppliers (name, mobile, address, details, previous_balance, created_at, updated_at)
   VALUES ('Supplier Name', '12345678901', 'Supplier Address', 'Additional Details', '500', NOW(), NOW());
   ```

4. **Insert a New Customer**  
   Use the following SQL command to add a customer:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO customers (name, mobile, address, details, previous_balance, created_at, updated_at)
   VALUES ('Customer Name', '12345678901', 'Customer Address', 'Additional Details', '1000', NOW(), NOW());
   ```

5. **Verify the Data**  
   Ensure the data has been added successfully by running:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM suppliers;
   SELECT * FROM customers;
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Errors**  
   Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database credentials and that MySQL is running.

2. **Permission Issues**  
   If you encounter file permission issues, ensure the Laravel project directories are writable:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
   ```

3. **Dependencies Errors**  
   If Composer fails to install dependencies due to PHP version incompatibility, ensure you're using PHP 7.4.
